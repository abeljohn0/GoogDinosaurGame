# GoogDinosaurGame
Built on Java, this is a replica of the google dinosaur game that uses the same physics of the original game, but varies the obstacles, background, and pace of the original.

If the code does not run correctly, this is likely because certain audio files are not downloaded on your device. To solve this, comment out any lines of code where the ".wav" files might be located in the DinoGame.java file. I've already done this with some of the lines of code, meaning it should run fine on your device.
